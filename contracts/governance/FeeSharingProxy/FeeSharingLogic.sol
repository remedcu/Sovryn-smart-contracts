/**
 * @title The FeeSharingLogic contract.
 * @notice Staking is not only granting voting rights, but also access to fee
 * sharing according to the own voting power in relation to the total. Whenever
 * somebody decides to collect the fees from the protocol, they get transferred
 * to a proxy contract which invests the funds in the lending pool and keeps
 * the pool tokens.
 *
 * The fee sharing proxy will be set as feesController of the protocol contract.
 * This allows the fee sharing proxy to withdraw the fees. The fee sharing
 * proxy holds the pool tokens and keeps track of which user owns how many
 * tokens. In order to know how many tokens a user owns, the fee sharing proxy
 * needs to know the user’s weighted stake in relation to the total weighted
 * stake (aka total voting power).
 *
 * Because both values are subject to change, they may be different on each fee
 * withdrawal. To be able to calculate a user’s share of tokens when he wants
 * to withdraw, we need checkpoints.
 *
 * This contract is intended to be set as the protocol fee collector.
 * Anybody can invoke the withdrawFees function which uses
 * protocol.withdrawFees to obtain available fees from operations on a
 * certain token. These fees are deposited in the corresponding loanPool.
 * Also, the staking contract sends slashed tokens to this contract. When a
 * user calls the withdraw function, the contract transfers the fee sharing
 * rewards in proportion to the user’s weighted stake since the last withdrawal.
 *
 * The protocol is collecting fees in all sorts of currencies and then automatically
 * supplies them to the respective lending pools. Therefore, all fees are
 * generating interest for the SOV holders. If one of them withdraws fees, it will
 * get pool tokens. It is planned to add the option to convert anything to rBTC
 * before withdrawing, but not yet implemented.
